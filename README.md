# headlessbrowser
Say goodbye to hassles and licensing fees with headlessbrowser on Docker!

While other headless browser solutions exist, they ofter come with licensing fees.
We didn't like that, so we created the headlessbrowser project - it's open-source and completly free for all uses, no licensing fees!
